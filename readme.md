## Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network🧬 for Face Mask😷 detection and face cover detection🕵🏻‍♂️

The main initial difficulty we encountered was building a dataset that was right for our purpose. There are many datasets on the web for training networks for face recognition but none of them had the right requirements we needed. This prompted us to create our own dataset built by unifying others with the following characteristics:

- 3828 images of uncovered faces (extracted from Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset[3])

- 3725 images of mask-covered faces(custom dataset scraped from google based on keywords which are royalty free and comes under fair use)

- 3710 random images (scraped from google are also royalty free and comes under fair use)
